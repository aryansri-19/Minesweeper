# Minesweeper
A simple Python program to demonstrate the classic game of Minesweeper using object oriented programming.

A class named 'Board' is used to instantiate a board object and parameters like side of board, number of mines, neighbouring mines, lost flag etc are initialised.

A simple recustion is applied to get the number of neighbouring safe spots of a particular coodrdinates.

Enjoy!!
